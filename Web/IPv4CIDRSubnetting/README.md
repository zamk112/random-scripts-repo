# Motivation
I have created a PowerShell script for calculating subnets from IPv4 CIDR ranges (See [IPv4CIDRSubnetting.ps1](../../PowerShell/IPv4CIDRSubnetting/IPv4CIDRSubnetting.ps1) file).

Although, it was quick and easy, I thought, having a HTML page with some Javascript and CSS would be better to display the information and have some visualisation to explain this better.

This is going to be a one page HTML document with some inline CSS and JavaScript to calculate and show the calculation with some visualisation from a IPv4 CIDR notation (since there's already plenty of online tools available, why not have one more :smiley:).
